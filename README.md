# lazycurl (zithril fork)

This is a fork of [lazycurl](https://github.com/BowTiedCrocodile/lazycurl) that we use as a real-world testbed for [zithril](https://github.com/hotschmoe/zithril), our Zig TUI framework. We're using this project to help mature zithril and find issues in the framework. Issues discovered during this migration are tracked at [hotschmoe/zithril/issues](https://github.com/hotschmoe/zithril/issues).
